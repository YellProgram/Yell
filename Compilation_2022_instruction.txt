Compilation on Mac 13 Dec 2022:

boost library is at https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0.zip/download, downloaded by hand
same for
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cxxtest/files/cxxtest/4.4/
http://users.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/levmar-2.6.tgz


Follow the following by hand
mkdir levmar
cd levmar
wget http://users.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/levmar-2.6.tgz .
tar -zxf levmar-2.6.tgz
rm levmar-2.6.tgz
mkdir levmar-build
cd levmar-build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DNEED_F2C:BOOL=0 -DBUILD_DEMO:BOOL=0 -DCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES:STRING=“Release” ../levmar-2.6

# not doing -DLAPACKBLAS_LIB_NAMES:STRING=" -framework accelerate" rather keep lapack;blas

make
cd ..
mkdir include
cp levmar-2.6/*.h include
mkdir lib
cp levmar-build/*.a lib

The hdf5 library is this one:
https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.8/hdf5-1.8.16/src/CMake-hdf5-1.8.16.zip
Configuring with CMAKE (lots of red warnings of incompatibility with CMAKE)
Turning on Build static libs

Run into a compilation error, trying the new CMAKE version instead
turn on "build static executables"

Get stuck with -static keyword very early with "ld: library not found for -lcrt0.o"
